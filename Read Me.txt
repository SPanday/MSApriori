The project has been coded in Python 3.6 and should work in any 3.x versions
of the language.
The program can be executed by running "python MSApriori.py" 
in the terminal. Please update the file names of the parameter and 
transactions file in the code. The files should be in the same 
directory as the program file, or the necessary changes can be 
made in the file location to access it from the code. The output would be 
displayed in the terminal as well as would be saved in text file.

Note : Any other format might not be read by the code successfully though the code 
will work with minor tweaks in the parser code.
